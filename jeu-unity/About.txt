"Human-computer interaction" project

Developed by Eliott Bell, Victor Faltings and Belén Gómez García

Bachelor, semester 4 (02.21.2022 - 06.05.2022) at EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne)



This project was developed in 3 steps:
- Developing a pre-determined game from provided assets by following precise instructions ("classic" game mode)
- Adding several pre-determined improvements to said game mode without clear guidance
- Creating our own game mode without limitations or instructions ("maze" game mode)

This game also supports a physical version using Cellulos (hexagonal wireless robots with haptic feedback, created at EPFL with educational purposes by a team of engineers) which the playable characters are designed after.

You can try out the game with Compiled Game/SpaceGhostSheep.exe and look at the underlying code in Raw Unity project/.

WHAT WE DID (located in Raw Unity project/Assets/):
The levels were build on Unity by us. The scripts we wrote by hand in C# were most scripts in Core/Behaviors/, Game/, Maze Game/, Menu/ and UI/ as well as PlayerMovement.cs. The sound effects Resources/GemCollected.wav and Resources/PointStolen.wav were also composed by yours truly.



Skills learned/worked on:
- Game developing with Unity
- C# coding
- UI design
- Task management and teamwork
